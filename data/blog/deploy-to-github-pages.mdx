In my YouTube video [Deploy using Git/GitHub Pages](https://youtu.be/fNP-td3_W3Y) I deployed previosly implemented [Quiz Application](https://www.devweb.blog/blog/quiz-app-youtube-video) to GitHub Pages using Git

Here are the links to [GitHub source code](https://github.com/DzmitryUr/quiz-app), [Deployed Quiz App](https://dzmitryur.github.io/quiz-app)

Deploying a JavaScript, HTML, CSS application to GitHub Pages is a simple process. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a GitHub Account and Install Git:**

   - If you don't have a GitHub account, sign up and install Git on your computer.

2. **Create a New Repository:**

   - Log in to your GitHub account and click on the "New" button to create a new repository.
   - Set the repository name and click on the "Create repository" button.

3. **Set Up the Repository:**

   - Follow the command line instructions provided by GitHub to initialize the repository on your local machine.

4. **Organize Your Project Files:**

   - Ensure that all your project files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) are added to the repository.

5. **Configure GitHub Pages:**

   - Go to your repository's settings on GitHub.
   - Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
   - Under "Source", select the branch you want to use for GitHub Pages (usually the main or master branch).
   - Optionally, choose a folder from your repository to serve as the root for your GitHub Pages site. If your project is at the root level of the repository, leave this blank.
   - Save your changes.

6. **Commit and Push Changes:**

   - Make sure all your changes are committed to the selected branch of your repository.
   - Push your changes to GitHub.

7. **Wait for Deployment:**

   - GitHub Pages will automatically build and deploy your site. This process may take a few moments.

8. **Access Your Site:**

   - Once the deployment is complete, you can access your site at `https://yourusername.github.io/repositoryname`. Replace "yourusername" with your GitHub username and "repositoryname" with the name of your GitHub repository.

9. **Custom Domain (Optional):**

   - If you have a custom domain, you can configure it to point to your GitHub Pages site following GitHub's instructions.

10. **Updating Your Site:**
    - Any changes you make and push to the selected branch will automatically update your GitHub Pages site.

That's it! Your JavaScript, HTML, CSS application is now deployed and accessible via GitHub Pages.
