I was so excited to finally share my first-ever YouTube video with the world! In this video, I wanted to show everyone how to make a cool Quiz App using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, even if they're just starting out.

First, I set up the basic structure of the app using HTML. Think of it like creating the skeleton of the app. Then, I used JavaScript to make the app actually work. This part was all about making the questions show up and checking if the answers were right or wrong.

But what's a cool app without some style? That's where CSS came in. I used it to make the Quiz App look awesome with colors, buttons, and cool designs.

I published the code to GitHub. You can see it at the link [Quiz App Code](https://github.com/DzmitryUr/quiz-app)
