summary: Creating Image Slider exercise can help improve JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills. In addition, building Image Slider in different variations is an often interview question for Frontend Engineers or Developers. In the video I demonstrated how you can create a slider element in less than 10 minutes.

In my YouTube video [Create simple Image Slider](https://youtu.be/MdEMbsA3bSU) I described the process of creation the carousel/slider element and then in another video demonstrated how to [Deploy Source Code and Application](https://youtu.be/arpBm_RpJQ0) to GitHub Pages using Git

Here are the links to [GitHub source code](https://github.com/DzmitryUr/slider) and [Deployed Slider App](https://dzmitryur.github.io/slider)

## What can you learn from Building a Slider App?

1. **HTML Structure and Semantics:** Understanding how to structure HTML for a slider app helps improve knowledge of HTML semantics and the importance of organizing content in a meaningful way.

2. **CSS Styling and Layout:** Building a slider requires styling elements for layout, positioning, transitions, and responsiveness. This experience increase CSS skills, including selectors, box model, flexbox.

3. **JavaScript Event Handling:** Implementing slider functionality involves handling user interactions, such as clicks on navigation buttons. This strengthens understanding of event-driven programming and event handling in JavaScript.

4. **DOM Manipulation:** Manipulating the DOM to show/hide slides.

5. **Array Methods and Iteration:** Managing slides and their order involves working with arrays of slide elements. This provides opportunities to practice iterating over arrays to perform specific tasks.

6. **Troubleshooting and Debugging:** Building a slider app often involves encountering and resolving issues such as unexpected behavior, errors, or browser inconsistencies. This develops problem-solving skills and proficiency in debugging techniques using browser developer tools and console logs.

By building a slider app, developers can gain valuable hands-on experience across various aspects of web development, improve coding skills, or prepare for a frontend interview.
