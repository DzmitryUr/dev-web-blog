## How to use a different GitHub account for a repository?

1. **Configure your Git Username and Email globally**:
   If you haven't already done so, you can configure your global Git settings with the username and email of the account you want to use. Open a terminal and use the following commands, replacing "primary_username" and "primary_email@example.com" with your GitHub account details:

   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "primary_username"
   git config --global user.email "primary_email@example.com"
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository**:
    Clone the repository you want to contribute to using the following command:   

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_URL>
    ```

3. **Change Directory to the cloned repository**:
   Navigate into the directory of the cloned repository using the cd command:

   ```bash
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

4. **Configure User locally for the Repository**:
   Inside the repository directory, configure your local Git settings with the username and email associated with the alternate GitHub account:   

   ```bash
    git config user.name "secondary_username"
    git config user.email "secondary_email@example.com"
    ```
