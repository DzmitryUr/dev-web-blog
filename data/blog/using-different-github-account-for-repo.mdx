The first challenge I faced when started the blog is how to use my personal GitHub account for the blog's repository.

1. **Configure Your Git Username and Email Globally**:
   If you haven't already done so, you can configure your global Git settings with the username and email of the account you want to use. Open a terminal and use the following commands, replacing "your_username" and "your_email@example.com" with your GitHub account details:

   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "your_username"
   git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository**:
    Clone the repository you want to contribute to using the following command:   

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_URL>
    ```

3. **Change Directory to the Cloned Repository**:
   Navigate into the directory of the cloned repository using the cd command:

   ```bash
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

4. **Configure User Locally for the Repository**:
   Inside the repository directory, configure your local Git settings with the username and email associated with the alternate GitHub account:   

   ```bash
    git config user.name "personal_username"
    git config user.email "personal_email@example.com"
