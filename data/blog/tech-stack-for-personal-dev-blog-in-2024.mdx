## Importance of Right Tech Stack for Personal Blog

When starting a blog, one of the most crucial decisions is selecting the right tech stack. Your tech stack determines the tools, frameworks, and languages you'll use to build and maintain your blog. With countless options available, choosing a tech stack that aligns with your goals, preferences, and technical proficiency is essential.

Building a personal blog with a defined tech stack provides an excellent opportunity for learning and growth. By working with new technologies and experimenting with different frameworks and tools, you can expand your skillset, deepen your understanding of web development concepts, and stay up-to-date with industry trends.

By carefully selecting and defining the technologies you'll use, you can create a blog that not only meets your needs but also reflects your unique personality and style.

## Defining Requirements for Personal Website

In this post, I'll talk about how I picked the tools to make my personal website. I'll explain what I thought about, the options I looked at, and why I chose what I did.

### Control over the Design and Functionality

Having control over how a website looks and works is really important to me as a developer. I like to be able to write the code myself, change how things look to fit what I want, and understand how everything functions. It's not just about making things work; it's about making them work the way I want them to. Being able to do this gives me the power to fix problems quickly, make things run smoother, and make the website better for everyone who uses it.

### Modern Tech Stack

I have experience with JavaScript, and I'm excited to use more modern tech stacks like Next.js, TypeScript, and React for my website. These tools have cool features that make it easier to build websites that do lots of things. Additionally, I prefer storing my code on GitHub because it allows me to track changes, collaborate with others, and maintain a version history of my projects. Overall, leveraging a modern tech stack and utilizing GitHub for version control will help me create a robust and efficient website that meets my goals and exceeds user expectations.

### Simplified Deployment

It would be awesome to simplify the deployment process by automating it. That way, whenever I make changes to my code and push them to GitHub, the latest version of my blog would automatically be published. This automation would save me time and effort, as I wouldn't need to manually deploy the changes every time I make an update. Instead, I could focus more on creating content and improving the functionality of my blog, knowing that the deployment process is taken care of automatically. Plus, it would ensure that my readers always have access to the most up-to-date version of my blog without any delays or interruptions.

### Performance and Speed

A good solution for the blog is a static website. Because static websites do not require server-side processing or database interaction, they are often simpler and faster to host and serve. They also tend to be more secure and easier to maintain, as there are no dynamic components that need to be updated or patched regularly.

## Possible Options for Creating Personal Blog

There are several options for building blogs:

- **Website Builders**\
  Website Builders offer user-friendly interfaces and drag-and-drop tools that make it easy to create and customize a website without any coding knowledge
- **Content Management Systems (CMS)**\
  CMS provides a more customizable and flexible option for building a personal website. With a CMS, you can install themes and plugins to customize your website's appearance and add features such as contact forms, galleries, and social media integration.
- **Static Site Generators (SSGs)**\
  SSGs generate static HTML files for each page of your website at build time. SSGs require familiarity with web development tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They offer greater control over design and content and can be hosted for free or at a lower cost than traditional CMS platforms.
- **Custom Development**\
  You can build your personal blog from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web development technologies. This option requires the most technical expertise but allows you to create a unique and tailored website that meets your specific needs and preferences.

## Decision about Tech Stack for my Blog

I did not consider website builders because they didn't match what I wanted for my blog. They're easy to use, but I needed more control and customization.

I thought about using WordPress because I've used it before and know PHP. But I wanted something more modern and simpler. WordPress can be a bit complex for what I need.

I considered making my blog from scratch, but that's better for bigger projects or simple landing pages. In addition, it could take more time than using some available templates.

So, I chose to use Static Site Generators. They're simple like static websites but can still do dynamic things. With Static Site Generators, I get the modern tools I want, like Next.js and React, while keeping my blog fast, safe, and easy to manage. This choice fits perfectly with what I want for my blog.
